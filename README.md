# Non-supervised-classification
This projetc was realized with Pablo Piguet, another student of my class. 

# Topic
This case study concerns the analysis of a database of handwritten signatures known as "online" signatures, i.e. signatures acquired on a digital device (e.g. tablet, smartphone). Thus, we can study the dynamics of the gesture produced during the signature.

The objective is to generate categories of people according to the complexity of their signatures. To do this, different techniques of unsupervised classification are applied, based on the given complexity measure. This complexity measure is based on a statistical modeling of signatures by a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) coupled with the Differential Entropy Measure. 

# Remark
All comments are in French as it is a project carried out in a school setting and intended to be evaluated by a French teacher.
